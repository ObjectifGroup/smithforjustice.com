- question: What qualifies me for this position?
  answer: I’m a native Texan with a law practice that has spanned multiple jurisdictions. I have clerked with the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara and worked for both large and small personal injury firms representing injured workers and their families. Cases I have worked on range from million dollar personal injury claims to typical business disputes. My career has aimed at solving problems with pragmatic solutions.

- question: What do you think are the biggest issues facing this position?
  answer: The biggest issues facing this position are independence, lack of public awareness and the scope of cases. In today’s political climate there is growing anger aimed at the courts, specific judges and decisions that courts make. One way to address this growing anger is for the justices to make the public more aware of the role of the Third Court of Appeals and how the court works. The final issue is the scope of the cases that come before the court. The Third Court of Appeals hears both civil and criminal appeals on a wide range of issues, so it is impossible for the justices to be experts on every topic and legal issue before the court. It is therefore important that the justices on this court come from diverse and varied backgrounds. With my background and experience I will bring a new perspective to the court.

- question: What motivated you to run for office?
  answer: My family and I have had many dinner time conversations about justice and what justice means to us. To me one of the overriding meanings of justice is that the courts are there for everyone. People must have faith that the courts are impartial and that the decisions made are sound and fair. One way for people to have faith in the courts is to give them a choice during elections. For example, when I go to vote I try to find candidates that share my same core constitutional values of genuine equality, liberty, justice and the rule of law. During the last election, I endeavored to be a solution for those who believe in the same core constitutional values.

- question: As justice, what are your goals?
  answer: My highest priority is being an impartial justice with a pragmatic and progressive approach to the cases before the court. As someone who has spent much of my career representing injured workers and their families I will bring a diversity of thought to the court that the Texans living within this Court of Appeals district deserve. I will also work with the other justices to ensure each case before the court is given a fair review and a just decision.
