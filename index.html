                <p>I am native Texan who was born in Dallas, raised in Fort Worth and went to college at Texas A&M University in College Station. After law school my wife, Casey, and I headed west to California and settled in San Francisco. After a couple years we got an itch for adventure and left San Francisco for Santiago, Chile. In 2008 when our time in Santiago came to an end we moved to Austin and have called Austin home ever since.</p>
                <p>Since moving to Austin our household has expanded to include three children. I have also taken up playing the banjo, piano and sandlot baseball for the East Austin Jardineros Baseball Club. My family and I attend the urban, progressive community of faith committed to social justice, inclusiveness and reconciliation known as University United Methodist Church in Austin.</p>
